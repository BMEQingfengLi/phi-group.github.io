<p>The precuneus network (PCN), or parietal memory network in some studies, refers to an intrinsic connectivity network anchors at the dorsal precuneus and the ventral posterior cingulate. In previous methodological studies, we discovered that this network and the default mode network (DMN) could be separated using ICA, and the PCN and DMN exhibited different cross-lifespan changes (Yang et al., 2012; 2014). This project aims to investigate why and how to separate PCN from DMN. We provide evidence from cross-lifespan development, heritability, clinical applications, and methodology to support that PCN stands as a different intrinsic connectivity network from DMN. Please see the ‚ÄúRead more‚Äù for a series of findings regarding this topic. We are still working on characterizing the specific functions of PCN.</p>
