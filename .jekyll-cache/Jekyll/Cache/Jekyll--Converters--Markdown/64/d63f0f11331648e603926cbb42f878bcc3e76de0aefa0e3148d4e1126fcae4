<p>The PHI-pipe is a multi-modal brain MRI data processing pipeline developed in PHI. Remarkable features of this pipeline include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A multi-modal pipeline for preprocessing of T1-3D, resting-state fMRI,  and DWI data. This is a one-stop solution if you have scanned  multi-modal images. Supported modality combinations are T1, T1+rest, and  T1+DWI.</li>
  <li>Supports automatic parallel computing. Make good use of computational power to automatically accelerate the processing.</li>
  <li>Gives multiple levels of results. You can get preprocessed images for your customized further analyses or just tables of parcel-wise measures (such as parcel-wise cortical thickness, reho, and functional connectivity matrices) for your statistical comparisons without touching the images.</li>
  <li>Makes quality control and quality check easy. The pipeline automatically evaluates and reports the quality of your data, and it generates figures for your visual check.</li>
  <li>Supports web-interface. We have implemented an easy-to-use website in our center, called WeProMRI, where users can do “one-click image preprocessing”</li>
</ul>

<p>The source code of the basic version of PHI-pipe can be downloaded at: …. Here is a user’s manual.</p>

<p>WeProMRITM is our implementation of a user-friendly website for automatical, parallel processing of multimodal brain MRI data. The pro-version of PHI-pipe with more functionalities underlies this website. Due to limited compuational resources, please contact us for accessing WeProMRI website. A tutorial for using WeProMRI is here</p>
