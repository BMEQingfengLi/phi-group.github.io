  gRAICAR is a Matlab package for data-driven subject community detection based on functional networks.
   
  When we cannot assume that all subjects share the same functional networks, we may want to look into the inter-subject similarity on each network. gRAICAR provides a tool for realizing such a purpose. gRAICAR first decomposes fMRI data into spatial components using independent component analysis (ICA), then aligns the spatial maps across the subjects, yielding an inter-subject similarity matrix for each aligned, group-level component. According to many ICA studies, some of these aligned components represent functional connectivity networks.

  The gRAICAR inter-subject similarity matrices reveal potential differences among subjects and thus accelerate data-driven discovery. Further, community detection algorithms applied to the gRAICAR intersubject similarity matrices can provide more quantitative metrics to characterize the associations between individual differences in functional networks and behaviors.

Mental health problems in children and adolescents have been a significant issue in China. We attempt to connect the mental health problems to individual differences in brain development that synthesizes and reflects genetic and environmental factors. We are closely collaborating with the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Shanghai Mental Health Center, to construct a neuroimaging cohort of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. In the future, we aim to extend this cohort into a full-spectrum neuroimaging cohort of mental disorders in children and adolescents.

Currently, our cohort has more than 200 samples; nearly half are patients with anxiety disorder. With these data, we found that adolescents (15-17 years) with social anxiety disorder exhibited higher grey matter volume in the orbital frontal gyrus and insula than age- and sex-matched typically developing adolescents. We observed disrupted co-variance between the gray matter volume of the insula, amygdala, and orbital frontal gyrus in the patients. These findings point to a delayed and unsynchronized brain development in adolescents with social anxiety disorder. See Liu, Hu et al., 2020, for details.
