  The PHI-pipe is a multi-modal brain MRI data processing pipeline developed in PHI. Remarkable features of this pipeline include:
   - A multi-modal pipeline for preprocessing of T1-3D, resting-state fMRI, and DWI data. This is a one-stop solution if you have scanned multi-modal images. Supported modality combinations are T1, T1+rest, and T1+DWI.
   - Supports automatic parallel computing. Make good use of computational power to automatically accelerate the processing.
   - Gives multiple levels of results. You can get preprocessed images for your customized further analyses or just tables of parcel-wise measures (such as parcel-wise cortical thickness, reho, and functional connectivity matrices) for your statistical comparisons without touching the images.
   - Makes quality control and quality check easy. The pipeline automatically evaluates and reports the quality of your data, and it generates figures for your visual check.
   - Supports web-interface. We have implemented an easy-to-use website in our center, called WeProMRI, where users can do "one-click image preprocessing"
